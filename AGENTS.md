## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Commit Rules

Commit messages must be in English and follow this format:

- Use the following semantic prefixes: `🎉 init, ✨ feat, 🐛 fix, 📚 docs, 💎 style, 📦 refator, 🚀 perf, 🚨 test, 🛠 build, ⚙️ ci, ♻️ chore, 🗑 revert`
- The message must be in the imperative mood and in lowercase.
- Write the commit body as a list.
- Reference an associated issue by number, if it exists, using the format `Issue: #<number>`.

Example:

```text
✨ feat: add product page

- Create product page
- Add product table
- Add product form

Issue: #1
```
